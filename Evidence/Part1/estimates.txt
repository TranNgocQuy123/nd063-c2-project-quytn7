Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1.- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
00:00 Occur on DB
00:05 Receive alert
00:08 AWS active failover and switche to database instance in standby.
00:10 In standby instance becomes active and database is ready for performance
RTO: Approximately about 10 minutes

2.- Minimum RTO for a single region outage
00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:13 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (7 minutes)

00:58 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
10:05 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

Total time: About 65 minutes or less

3.- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
We use multi AZ database with automated backups everyday is enabled, it take a few minutes to failover. So downtime a few minutes

4.- Minimum RPO for a single region outage
we use automatic everyday is enabled, the RPO will be based on data is backed up. If we set up a backup every 4 hours, the minimun RPO will be 4 hours. and reduce lost data.
